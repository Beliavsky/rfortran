Progress toward compiling `kind.f90 util.f90 xutil.f90`

The first completed checkpoint fixes character-literal lexing and semicolon
statement separators. `util.f90` uses strings containing a single backslash
when building Windows paths, and places several statements on one line.
Previously, the lexer interpreted a backslash before a quote as a C escape,
swallowing subsequent source text and producing misleading diagnostics.

Backslashes are now literal characters. Quotes inside a string are represented
by doubled delimiters: `'It''s Fortran'` or `"Say ""hello"""`. Semicolons outside
strings and comments separate statements. Unterminated strings stop at the
line boundary instead of consuming subsequent lines. Dotted defined-operator
names such as `.in.` are now recognized as individual tokens, including in
OPERATOR interface/accessibility declarations; their expression syntax and
execution remain unimplemented. Continued character
literals across source lines are not implemented by this change.

Test 59 is a small executable reproduction covering these cases, including
empty strings, Windows paths, and semicolons after CASE selectors. Its output
is checked against gfortran and both compiler backends. Lexer unit tests also
check token positions and recovery after an unterminated literal.

The old block test used the nonstandard C-style `\n` escape. It now uses two
PRINT statements to retain its intended output under Fortran string rules.
Code that relied on C escapes in source strings must similarly be updated;
there is currently no switch to enable backslash escapes.

The full utility program still does not compile. The next front-end blockers
include `USE ..., ONLY:`, named generic interfaces, and user-defined dotted
operators such as `.in.` and `.exclude.`. The utility library also exercises
features beyond the currently implemented array, character, and I/O subsets.
